# Visual-Mobile-Sorting-Algorithms
1. This app Implements several common sorting algorithms to sort
an array of integers.
2. You can select the algorithms and the size
of the array. The data in the array to be sorted are
randomly generated (shuffled) each time.
3. The progress of the sorting algorithms is animated by
displaying the state of the array being sorted in a fashion
similar to what is in the sample UI. There are small delays in
the algorithms so that the progress is observable at a
comfortable pace.
4. There is a dispatch queue used to execute the sorting algorithms
on a thread other than the main thread.
